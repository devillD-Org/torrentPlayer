# TORRENTPLAYER

NodeJS app that helps to search,choose and play torrents files within the PirateBay and YPS API.

Torrentplayer is a shell/terminal app, pretty much just functional shit, so no fancy UI here.

Download and extract the [latest pre-built release](git@github.com:juananime/torrentPlayer.git).

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.
